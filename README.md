# Efficient-Appointment-Book-Management-using-Binary-Search-Tree-Data-Structure

• Re-implemented the ApptBook ADT using a binary search tree (BST) data structure.
• Completed the homework assignment by implementing various methods and helper functions.
• Ensured the BST is balanced to maintain efficient insert and lookup mechanisms.
• Handled duplicates by placing them in the right subtree of existing equivalent elements.
• Implemented a cursor for iteration through the BST, advancing to the next element.
• Developed and utilized recursive helper methods for tasks such as cloning, inserting, and checking tree properties.
• Tested the implementation using provided internal tests and ensured correct functionality.
• Implemented additional methods, including wellFormed, start, isCurrent, getCurrent, advance, setCurrent, insert, clone, and
insertAll.
• Debugged and refined the implementation using regular tests and random tests.
• Verified efficiency by running the efficiency tests to ensure handling a million entries.
• Started the assignment early and utilized recursion for cleaner and more efficient code.
